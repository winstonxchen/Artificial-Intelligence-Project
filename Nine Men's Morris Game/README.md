# Nine Men's Morris Game
**Technology: MiniMax Algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning.**

The program consists of eight python files. 
There are two phases in the game: Opening phase of the game and End/Mid Game, for each phase:
MiniMaxOpening: Implements the MiniMax algorithm to find the next move in the Opening Phase of game for white. 
MiniMaxGame: Implements the MiniMax algorithm to find the next move in the Mig/End Phase of game for white. 
MiniMaxOpeningBlack:Implements the MiniMax algorithm to find the next move in the Opening Phase of game for black. 
MiniMaxGameBlack:Implements the MiniMax algorithm to find the next move in the Mig/End Phase of game for black. 
MiniMaxOpeningImproved:Implements the MiniMax algorithm with Improvement to find the next move in the Opening Phase of game for white. 
MiniMaxGameImproved:Implements the MiniMax algorithm with Improvement to find the next move in the Mig/End Phase of game for white. 
ABOpening:Implements the AB algorithm to find the next move in the Opening Phase of game for white. 
ABGame:Implements the AB algorithm to find the next move in the Mig/End Phase of game for white.

The program takes three agruments: board1.txt board2.txt 2

board1.txt: input board position board2.txt: output file location 2: depth upto which the algorithm should run

Examples:
  1. First program: MiniMaxOpening The first program plays a move in the opening phase of the game. For example, the input can be: (you type:) board1.txt board2.txt 2 (the program replies:) Board Position: xxxxxxxxxWxxWxxxBxxxxxx Positions evaluated by static estimation: 9. MINIMAX estimate: 9987. Here it is assumed that the file board1.txt content is: xxxxxxxxxWxxxxxxBxxxxxx The file board2.txt is created by the program, and its content is: xxxxxxxxxWxxWxxxBxxxxxx

  2. Second program: MiniMaxGame The second program plays in the midgame/endgame phase. For example, the input can be: (you type:) board3.txt board4.txt 3 (the program replies:) Board Position: xxxxxxxxWWWxWWxBBBBxxxx. Positions evaluated by static estimation: 125. MINIMAX estimate: 9987. Here it is assumed that the file board3.txt exists and its content is: xxxxxxxxxxWWxWWxBBBxxxx The file board4.txt is created by the program, and its content is: xxxxxxxxWWWxWWxBBBBxxxx
